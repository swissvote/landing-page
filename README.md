The white paper lays out the vision and technical details behind SwissVote, which utilizes a novel integration of SwissID, the Internet Computer Protocol, and zero-knowledge cryptography to enable voting that is secure, private, transparent, accessible, and trustworthy.

The goals of SwissVote are to:

- Develop a digital voting system tailored specifically for Switzerland's needs and democratic values.

- Address the challenges faced by traditional voting methods in security, accessibility, transparency, and voter participation.

- Leverage decentralized architecture and advanced cryptographic techniques to protect the integrity and sanctity of the voting process. 

- Serve as a model for other nations to embrace technology-enabled democracy while upholding founding principles.

In addition to the white paper PDF, this repo contains code for a promotional website that introduces SwissVote at a high level to the general public. The site is implemented with HTML, TailwindCSS for styling, and FontAwesome icons.
